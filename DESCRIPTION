Description: Functionality for working with virtual machines (VMs) in Microsoft's 'Azure' cloud: <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/>. Includes facilities to create, startup, shutdown, and cleanly delete VMs and VM clusters. With a running VM, execute scripts and install optional extensions. A selection of VM templates based on the 'Data Science Virtual Machine' (DSVM) is supplied; this allows fast and easy provisioning of a VM preinstalled with several software packages useful for data science. Alternatively, users can provide VM templates of their own.
